        <h1>Help</h1>
        <p>
            Send a PUT to http://big-sign.yhs:8080/topics/[SOME_TOPIC] containing
            a JSON object like so:
        </p>
        <code>
            {
                "lines": [
                    "Each of these lines will be shown",
                    "one at a time",
                    "in order"
                ]
            }
        </code>
        <p>
            On push, your message will be shown immediately, then enter the rotation
            of other topics.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can use any name you like for the topic (they will be visible to others!),
            re-using a topic Id will replace the contents of the topic.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a line-length limit of 60 characters. There's not limit on the number
            of lines per topic but bear in mind that annoyingly long messages are likely
            to be removed by others ;)
        </p>
